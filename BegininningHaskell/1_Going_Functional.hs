-- 1 Going Functional

-- purity - separates code with side effects from the rest
-- lazy evaluation model
-- compiler statically checks types
-- polymorphism by parametricity and type classes

-- functional - functions are first class citizens, 
--              manipulated like any other data in a program
-- imperative - methods that consists of statements that modify a global state

-- Type system - restricts possible actions that could be applied to a value
-- dynamic typing - checking types at execution time
-- static typing - checking types at the moment of compilation

-- interactive multiline block:
:{
    1/3 + 
    1/2
:}

-- internal actions of the interpreter
